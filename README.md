DynamicAtlasCeatorAirDemo
=========================

AIR version of Dynamic Texture Atlas with saving to ApplicationStorageDirectory for reuse.

Web version with details can be found here
https://github.com/juwalbose/DynamicAtlasCreator

AIR version saves the created dynamic atlas into ApplicationStorageDirectory & tries to reuse it if found for all 
subsequent runs. `DynamicAtlasCreator` class remains the same with just minor changes to keep the created `BitmapData` 
in addition to the creation of the corresponding new XML data. Once saved these can be disposed by calling the `dispose` 
method. Supports texture 'frame' as well thus creating an optimised atlas.

`ResourceManager` class handles the saving & loading of the `DynamicAtlas`.

Other dependencies are [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/), [AS3 Signals](https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals), [TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/) (can be removed by using `Juggler` instead)

Usage

```actionscript
DynamicAtlasCreator.creationComplete.add(creationComplete);//AS3 Signal will be dispatched

DynamicAtlasCreator.createFrom(bitmapData,xml,scale,assets,atlasName);
```

Where 
bitmapData > the super texture atlas image BitmapData

xml > super atlas XML

scale > the ratio to scale down to. eg, for 1024 x 768 this can be 0.5

assets > default Starling AssetManager class which will be populated with new textures

atlasName > the file name for saving the atlas texture & xml. atlas xml needs to store reference to texture name.

Thank you Daniel Sperl for the idea, inspiration & all the help. Thanking Ville Koskela for the wonderful Rectangle 
packing algorithm which enables this to work.
